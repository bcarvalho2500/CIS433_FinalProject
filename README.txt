Car Builder (Final Project) by Brandon Carvalho & Vincent Gardner

Screens:
    HomePage - This is where the user can get a brief description of the app as well as find nearby
        dealerships and schedule a test drive. The user can also start building a car from this screen.
    CarListings - This screen show both sedans and suvs that the user can customize. They can then select
        the vehicle that they want to customize.
    CarCustomizer - This screen is where the user can pick options to customize the car that they chose
        from the previous screen. From this screen the user will be able to save their build
    Garage - The garage is where the user will find all of their saved builds. From here they can delete
        their build.

Optional Features:
    - Allow the user to select date and time
    - Display data using recycler view
    - Display data on tabs
    - Alert Dialogs
    - Using checkboxes or radio buttons
    - GPS/Location awareness

Usage:
    - App was run on a Pixel 6 with API 33 on a Macbook. Reason for specifying a Macbook is because on the
    car building screen sometimes the scollview pushes the save build button out of view
    - Calendar does not work on emulator. It was tested on a physical device and demonstrated in class

Lessons Learned:
    - Learned a new intent on how to send over data to a calendar
    - Great experience to build a complete app from the ground up
